## About The Project

Please note that this is not the official app for Timepage for macOS, but rather an enthusiast’s project that was created mainly for learning macOS development through mimicking the app. 

There are some features I didn't implement into the app simply because I don't have the need for it, such as creating a new event or adding reminders. Maybe I'll do it someday, new version will be posted on GitHub if I ever decide to implement it. 

A hidden bar is placed in the middle which you drag to change the proportion between heatmap and calendar, click the month indicator to hide heatmap entirely.
